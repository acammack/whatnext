Whatnext
========

Whatnext is a lightweight tool to keep you on track. It is a simple shell layer
over the file system designed for use from the command line or in scripts.
Combined with source control, it allows for powerful tracking of what you
should do next.

Each task is a file on your computer. Task requirements, notes, completion
estimates, and deadlines can go there, but `whatnext` doesn't care. These files
are grouped together into folders called projects. Managing a project as a git
repository allows for collaboration and history control beyond most dedicated
task management systems.

Usage
-----

```
whatnext [echo]
```
Displays the path of the current task and its contents, if it exists. If there
is no current task, the tasks in the queue will be display. If no tasks are
queued, all open tasks will be displayed.

```
whatnext add <project> <task_name>
```
Creates a new task under the heading `<project>` and opens the underlying file
for editing. `<project>` is created if is does not exist.

```
whatnext queue <project> <task_name>
```
Marks a task as ready to be worked on. A task that does not exist will be
created as with `whatnext add`. Finished tasks can be added back to the queue
by prepending a `.` to their names.

```
whatnext start <project> <task_name>
```
Marks a task as the current one being worked on and opens the underlying file
for editing. It must be in the queue before it can be started. Started tasks
remain in the queue until they are complete and can be preempted at any time.

```
whatnext finish
```
Marks a task as complete and opens the underlying file for editing. This
removes it from the queue and prepends a `.` to underlying file so it is does
not clutter up the output of other commands (unless you are looking for it). It
then prompts you to select another task (starting with the project you were
working on).

```
whatnext open [<project> <task_name>]
```
Opens the underlying file for editing. It defaults to the current task if not
specified.

```
whatnext ls
```
Lists all tasks that are queued. If no tasks are queued, all open tasks will be
displayed.

```
whatnext tree
```
Runs `tree` on the whatnext directory for examination. Requires the `tree`
program to be installed.

```
whatnext grep <project> [options] <pattern>
```
Searches through the project for files with names or contents matching
`<pattern>`. Any options provided are passed straight through to `grep`.

Installation
------------

Put the `whatnext` file somewhere in your path, make it executable, and source
the `whatnext-ac.sh` file in your `.bashrc` if you want tab completion
(requires bash-completion to be installed). Alias `whatnext` to `wn` for even
more speed (be sure to add `complete -F _whatnext wn` to your `.bashrc` if you
don't want to lose tab completion).
